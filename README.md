### Code Structure:

- **CSS**: The styling features a modern design with a gradient background, rounded input fields, and hover effects for interactive elements. The layout is organized using CSS Grid and Flexbox for a clean presentation.
- **JavaScript**: The script fetches weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API, processes the response, and updates the UI dynamically based on user input.
